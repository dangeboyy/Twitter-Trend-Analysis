Sentiment analysis of twitter topics

This project is made in order for users to see public opinion on trends quickly and without prejudice. 
It is known that social media sites generally create an echo chamber by showing users more of the content 
that the user ideologically agrees with.Thanks to this website people can save time and effort when seeing 
unfiltered and unbiased metrics and charts. The website uses Twitter API to get the trending topics and the 
website will use natural language processing libraries such as Polyglot, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), 
Vocabulary, Zemberek to feed the data mining algorithm. The website will use opinion mining algorithms which
is a subfield of data mining. We will be making a website that will show you the public opinion on trending 
topics of the past week. You will be able to search for these topics and will be able to see charts and metrics
on the topic and see the public opinion without an unfiltered perspective. In this site users will be able to
see charts and metrics on the topics so matplotlib, pandas and numpy will be used for these features. The website
will be made with javascript, node.js, bootstrap, pug and express framework. Our project scope also includes
comparing the public opinion of different countries on certain social issues which will help our users gain
different perspectives on ongoing events.
